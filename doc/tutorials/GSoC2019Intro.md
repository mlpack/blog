@section mlpack-in-google-summer-of-code-2019 mlpack in Google Summer of Code 2019

In 2019 mlpack applied again for Google Summer of Code. That’s the sixed year in
a row and our 5th Summer of Code in total. We received an astounding number of
applications and were able to accept 10 talented students. Here is what they will
be working on this summer:

### [Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `SangYeon Kim`, mentored by `Sumedh Ghaisas`**

SangYeon will implement the Quantum Gaussian Mixture Model (QGMM) for Quantum
Clustering, on top of that he will run different experiments to see how fast the
method trains, how the method models the data, and search for edge cases and
compare it with the classical GMM.

### [Essential Deep Learning Modules](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Toshal Agrawal`, mentored by `Shikhar Jaiswal`**

Toshal will provide flexible and extensible implementation of Least Squares
Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs), Label Smoothing, Bidirectional GAN
(BIGAN) and Stacked Generative Adversarial Network (StackGAN). In addition
Toshal also aims at providing techniques to measure GAN performance like
Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).

\note
"In my free time I like travelling, reading and playing soccer."

### [Essential Deep Learning Modules](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Saksham Bansal`, mentored by `Shikhar Jaiswal`**

Saksham will implement novel techniques for training GANs efficiently such as
mini-batch discrimination, virtual batch normalisation and additionally, adding
support for Conditional GAN (CGAN). Future work for Stacked GAN (SGAN) is also
proposed.

\note
"In my free time I like watching movies (I recently saw John Wick 3) and reading
"books."

### [Application of ANN Algorithms](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Mehul Kumar Nirala`, mentored by `Marcus Edel, Sumedh Ghaisas`**

Mehul will implement various network models using some of the existing building
blocks. He will implement VGG 19 for Image Classification, LSTM Networks for
Sentiment Analysis, and LSTM for time series prediction.

\note
"I usually watch horror, kind of weird but I like it."

### [String Processing Utilities](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Jeffin Sam`, mentored by `Mikhail Lozhnikov`**

Jeffin will implement String Processing Utilities for boosting mlpack library to
manipulate string data types and to convert it into numeric datatype to apply
machine learning algorithms.

\note
"I like to watch stand-up comedy in my free time."

### [Advanced Kernel Density Estimation Improvements](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Roberto Hueso Gomez`, mentored by `Ryan Curtin`**

Roberto will work on improvements for the already existing KDE codebase;
including improvements in cases where: the data dimensionality is high and the
current implementation suffers because of kernel bandwidth scale.

\note
Likes everything related to space.

### [mlpack-Tensorflow Translator](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Sreenik Seal`, mentored by `Ryan Curtin`**

Sreenik will work on a converter that can translate models built in Tensorflow,
Keras, Pytorch, Mxnet, ONNX to mlpack's model format and vice-versa. He will
also work on displaying the required mlpack code to create a corresponding
model.

\note
"I am not a very big fan of movies. I like to play computer games instead."

### [NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies & Multi-Objective Optimization](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Rahul Ganesh Prabhu`, mentored by `Marcus Edel`**

Rahul will implement a NEAT framework as well a framework for multi-objective
optimization.

\note
Likes everything around robotics.

### [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Xiaohong Ji`, mentored by `Manish Kumar, Marcus Edel`**

Xiaohong will implement a new family of policy gradient methods for
reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through
interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective
function using stochastic gradient ascent.

\note
"In my free time, I like to swimming, cooking. Swimming is really a good way to
"relax the body."


### [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas)
** `Suryoday Basak`, mentored by `Marcus Edel`**

Suryoday will implement different variants of particle swarm optimization for
ensmallen.

\note
"Since my childhood, I've been a musician - and I'm trained a bit in Western
classical as well as Hindustani."
