@section roberto-2019-week-02 Implementing probabilistic KDE error bounds - Week 2

This week has been more about trying to solve a problem rather than implementing
it. I couldn't get this improvement to work as it should, so I asked for help
to my mentor Ryan. Finally, after a week of trials and thanks to his help,
we're making some progress :)

Estimations seem to be getting to a reasonably good point and might fully
work as expected soon. This sounds like a good time to start implementing the
actual API for handling the new KDE parameters.

I have also been exploring how trees are implemented in mlpack, this is going
to be useful for the next improvement we'll be working on.
