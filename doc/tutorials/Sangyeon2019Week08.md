@section Sangyeon2019WeekEight Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models - Week 8

This week, I've researched QGMM and organized some documents. There are two documents. First, the document of the validity of the objective function. We want to check if QGMM works correctly when minimizing the objective function using Adam optimizer. So, this research's aim is to check whether QGMM can be trained given observations with randomly initialized means. Second, the document of lambda impact. The objective function uses lambda as a weight of the approximation constraint. Therefore, we can adjust the importance of constraint in the objective function by changing the value of lambda. So, this research's aim is to check if How are the results different as lambda changed. However, the second document isn't complete, so I'm currently doing more researches.

Thanks for reading :)
