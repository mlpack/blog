@section Jeffin2019Week08-11 Visualization Tool - Week 08 - 11

Sorry for being late in updating the blogs, but this Post would contain updates from Week 08 through 11, So let's start.

Over the week we were able to merge two PRs, the first one was [text-support](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/7) and then [prcurver-support](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/12). 

Also we have a pr for [embedding-support](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/10), ready to be merged and hope full would be merge this week.

Two fresh PR's were raised, the first one was for [histogram-support](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/13) and then [mlbaord_logger-callback](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/15). The callback is the last agenda on our list before the program ends. 

Lastly before the program ends we had some stretch goals, we would like to acheive that too. A bit of cleaning also needs to be done such as improving cmake, there are some issues raised about it such as [https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/issues/14](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/issues/14) and [https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/issues/8](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/issues/8).

Thank you :)
