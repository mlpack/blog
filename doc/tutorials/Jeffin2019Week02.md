@section Jeffin2019Week02 String Processing Utilities - Week 02

This week I raised a new [PR1927](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1927) to provide Bag of Words functionality, which followed the same model as DictionaryEncoding [PR1814](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1814), but with different implementation. Also, made minor clean ups of other PR, and also decided to implement EncodingPolicy which will handle the encoding process.

The functionalites of [PR1876](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1876) are almost done and I also got it approved, will be merged soon. Next week I would try to merge both DictionaryEncoding class and Bag of Words class, and would try to build bindings for String Cleaning functionalites.

Thank you :)
