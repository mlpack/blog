@section Rahul2019Week07 NEAT & Multiobjective Optimization - Week 10

I'm sorry for not posting an update in a while. My college restarted recently, and it's been very hectic, and difficult to find time to do work. Moreover, the college has released new IT rules that are very restrictive. Luckily, I'm far enough ahead to complete the project in time, despite these constraints.

The last two weeks, I have been reading a lot of papers on multi-objective optimization and have implemented the test functions in ensmallen. I'm currently writing the optimizer, but I am facing some difficulty when it comes to this since the only existing working implementation I was able to find uses numpy which I am not too familiar with. I'm confident I can finish it before the end of this week though. I've also been addressing review comments on the NEAT PR while working on ensmallen.

Thanks for reading!
