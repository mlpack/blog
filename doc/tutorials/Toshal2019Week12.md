@section Toshal2019Week12 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 12

Well my `Bias visitor` PR is merged. Also my `exact-objective` PR is merged. I also added a workaround to enable adding more layers to the `ANN`. It looks like we can have as many layers as we want. We can always develop a tree like structure for adding more layers. The most interesting thing about the workaround PR was that the `Branch` of the PR could be deleted just after two days of it's creation.

As soon as the workaround for adding more layer got merged, My `Weight-Normalization` layer was ready to merge. My `Inception Layer` can also be now merged and I will start working on it soon.

In the upcoming week, I am thinking to add a small test for `LSGAN` so that it can get merged. It's actual image testing would need some time. Most of the online available tests use `Dual Optimizer`. So deciding the parameters for training would be challenging. If poosible I will also try to finish my work on `Inception Layer`.

I am also currently testing my `Dual Optimizer` PR. It's running from long time on savannah approximately (50 Days). Hopefully, I see good results after it gets completed :)
