@section Jeffin2019Week07 String Processing Utilities - Week 07

This week, I finally completed the interface of the base class for encoding, and got it approved. We used SFINAE to block the function that outputs a matrix without padding for the Dicitonary encoding policy.

I also started working on String cleaning Interface, refactored the code a liltle bit. For the coming weeks I will first finish up with this and then go for the other policies for Encoding Class.

Thank you :)
