### Tasks
* I have completed implementation of VGG19 for MNIST dataset [PR #28](https://github.com/mlpack/models/pull/28).
  * Started the training with batch_size:32, no_of_iterations_per_cycle: 10, no_of_cycles: 42.
* I have also started working on imagenet dataset.

### Next Week Goals

* Completing the PR on Image Loading: I am lagging in this PR so by this week I will complete it by incorporating the necessary reviews.
* VGG19-MNIST : I will complete the documentation with training results.
* VGG19-Imagnet: I will start working on VGG19 for Imagenet dataset.

Thanks for reading. Have a nice day :smile:
