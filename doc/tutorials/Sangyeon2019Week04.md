@section Sangyeon2019WeekFour Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models - Week 4

In the week 3, I did visualize the QGMM and the integral areas to check if them are correct.

This week, I worked on implementing quantum EM algorithm in Python to check if it is vaild.
<br>
Before implementing the em algorithm of QGMM, I implemented GMM classes according to mlpack codebases.
* GaussianDistribution
* GMM
* EMFit

Then, I checked if the codes were wrriten correctly by training the GMM model with random observations.

Thanks for reading :)
