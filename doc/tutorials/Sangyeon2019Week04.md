@section Sangyeon2019WeekFour Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models - Week 4

In the week 3, I did visualize the QGMM and the integral areas to check if them are correct.

This week, I worked on quantum EM algorithm implementation in Python code for simple check.

Next week, I'll code the quantum GMM in mlpack code base and write some test sutes.

Thanks for reading :)
