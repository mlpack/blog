@section Mehul2019WeekFive Application of ANN Algorithms Implemented in mlpack - Week 5

### Tasks
* Completed the PR on image saving feature.
* Written tutorials on how to use image utilities for loading and saving images.
* Added global max & mean pooling to VGG19 model.

## Results

* Initially I wanted to perform sentiment analysis using LSTM. However, the string encodings are not ready. Hence I took up the Multivariate time series analysis which was planned around week 9 (So I am exchaning the task of week 6-7 with week 8-9).
* Completed the PR on Image Loading in accordance data::Load() and data::Save() API calls.

### Next Week Goals
* Revise the tutorials for image loading/saving.
More to be added ..

Thanks for reading. Have a nice day :smile:
