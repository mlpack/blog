@section Toshal2019Week05 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 5

It looks like I am writing this blog after 16 days of my previous blog. I am highly sorry for being so unprofessional.

I will summarize the last two weeks together. I have started implemenation of `FID`. I am needing Inception network for testing it.
I have gone through the Inception module of Inception Network. At first I am thinking to implement `naive Inception module`. After that I am thinking to implement it fully. It looks like a daunting task. But it's quite interesting.

I have obtained some other useful insights about the failing radical test. Hopefully, I will fix it this week. Meanwhile in the last week I have got some useful reviews from `zoq` and `ShikharJ` and I hope that my PRs will get merge soon. Some minor discussion on `weight norm` layer is done and I will work on it soon. Also, My first evaluation is done and I am quite happy about that. One month has went in no time.
I hope that I am more productive in my next two phases.

From 26th July to 30th July I was quite busy in my college placement activities. Luckily, I am placed in the first company of my college. I am just feeling relieved after that. I also won a hackathon during same time. I am highly sorry. I should have informed this earlier to my mentor. I was just running over here and there in those 4 days so I just forgot that.

In the next four to five days I am planning to get back on track.
