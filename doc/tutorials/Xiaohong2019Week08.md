@section Xiaohong2019Week 8 Proximal Policy Optimization - Week 8


This week, I finished all functionality of PPO, such as update the actor and critic model. 
Synchronizing the oldActorNetwork. I made the code consistent with the latest code which 
modifies the Pendulum environment. I fixed some bugs in the `Step` and `Update` function.
But there are some bugs like `memory access violation` need to fix. Next week, I will focus
on those bugs and tuning the parameter to make it work.  


Thanks for reading :).
