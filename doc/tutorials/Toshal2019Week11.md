@section Toshal2019Week11 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 11

In the last two weeks I have completed the `exact-objective` PR. Also my `Weight Norm` layer is quite complete and it's ready to merge. Both of the PR's required some time but they are now ready to merge.

My `radical_test` PR also got merged. It was quite weird that the `Memory Check` was timing out even after 15 hours of build. But yes after merging the build is getting passed without any issues. May be there could be a glitch around the system.

I have also started to implement `LSGAN`. It's almost complete. I will need to add some validation to ensure that the corect loss function is used for `LSGAN`. Testing it on savannah will also take sometime.

In the upcoming week I am aiming to complete `LSGANs` and the `Inception Layer` module. If possible I will also start working on `BIGAN`.
