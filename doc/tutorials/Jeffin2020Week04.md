@section Jeffin2020Week04 Visualization Tool - Week 04

Hi, Welcome to another blog, This week was less of coding and more of research, I did go through the implementation of logging histogram summary and pr-curve summary and also text summary. And now I am more than familiar with them and would implement them over the next two weeks.

Also last week, I implement support for logging text summary, you can view the pr [here](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/7), It needs to be reviewed and polished. The Catch-testing [PR](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/5) was merged after some hiccups of `mkdir()` and `rmdir()` function which caused a problem in the different operating systems. And Also some polishing was done in Image-support pr after some small reviews.

Also, an attempt was made [here](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/9) to set up CI workflow for windows operating system for the repo, The dependencies were installed and configured correctly but for some reasons mlboard build failed. I am not the best person to know about windows os and haven't used for almost 3 years and hence I would take some time to look into it and debug it. But parallelly I would work on adding logging support for other summary types.

That's it for this blog, Will keep you updated with the future progress. Till then Bye.
