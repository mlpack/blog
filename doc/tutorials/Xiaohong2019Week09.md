@section Xiaohong2019Week 9 Proximal Policy Optimization - Week 9


This week, I fixed the bug `memory access violation` and some bugs that troubled me 
for a long time. I find that more problem than I expected. This is my first time writing 
model with loss calculated outside the model. I was familiar with PyTorch and TensorFlow,
so I write code with the original stereotype. Such as I thought that the Normal distribution
will accept mean and variance as parameters, in fact, it accepts mean and covariance as 
parameters. I am wondering whether I rewrite distribution to make it consistent with 
PyTorch framework. With mentor kindly remind, I realized that I am a little bit 
behind my schedule. Yes, it is. I am too optimistic about the workload, I think 
I need to devote more time to speed up the progress.


Thanks for reading :).
