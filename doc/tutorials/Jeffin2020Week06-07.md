@section Jeffin2019Week06-07 Visualization Tool - Week 06 - 07

Sorry for being late in updating the blogs, but this Post would contain updates from Week 06 and 07, So let's start.

So the [image-support-pr](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/6) was merged, and last week two new pr was raised which was to add support for [embedding-summary](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/10) and also [prcurve-summary](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/12). Hopefully, we would be able to merge all the three PRs including the PR for [text-summary](https://github.com/mlpack/mlboard/pull/7).

In the upcoming week, I would like to debug an error in embedding-support pr and would target adding histogram summary. So My target would be two add all the support before entering in the third phase.

And in the third phase, I would focus on writing a ensmallen callback to log the data and then all clean up if there are any and improve testing if coverage if possible.


Thank you :)
