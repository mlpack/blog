@section Toshal2019Week02 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 2

In this week I have started testing `Dual Optimizer` PR on savannah. It looks like it will take sometime to give out the results.
In this week the work was quite slow. My college has started once again and I was required to attend lectures.

I have also started working on weight norm layer. Weight Norm layer would be a wrapper arround another layers and it works to
reparametrize the weights of the wrapped layer. I have written the template code. But, the implemenation has got somewhat tricky.

In the meantime  ShikharJ reviewed my `Serialization` PR once. It looks like it will get merge soon. After this I thing GANs will be ready to get realeased.

In the next week I am thinking to complete with the weight norm layer and after that moving to orthogonal regularization if possible. If my `Lablel Smoothing` gets merged then I can also start testing LSGANs side by side. I hope that the testing of Dual Optimizer gets completed soon.
