@section Saksham2019Week7 Implementing Improved Training Techniques for GANs - Week 7

This week I was working on implementing the `Padding` layer. The implementation of the layer itself is now complete and I am working on adding tests and refactoring the code for convolutional layers. Reading and understanding the code for the convolutional layers took more time than expected. Other than that I am looking at the implementations of spectral normalization technique and trying to compute the backpropogation for that.

I think that the `Padding` layer should be merged within a week or two and then I will continue with the implementation of the `SpectralNorm` layer.
