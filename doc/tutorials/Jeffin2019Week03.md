This week I made minor cleanups in my old PR for Dictionary Encoding Class and Bag of Words Class. Also came back to feature selection PR as I did had some free time up my sleves.

Also First Evaluation Began and I have filled up the Feedback within 5 mins :). Also I starting Working on implementation of TF-IDF Class and would soone raise a PR for that class.

My college is resuming from 2nd of July :( and thus I am treavelling back to my college from home. Long Train Journey of 36 Hours. Will spare some time to code while travelling. 

Thank you :)
