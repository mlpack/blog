Probably I am late in posting about Community Bonding Period, but still :). This summer I will be working on implementing different String Processing Utilities ranging from basic funtion to clean string to complex one such as word2vec. My mentor would be `Mikhail Lozhnikov`.

So as of during comunity bonding period, I tried finishing up my old PRs, Dictionary encoding [PR1814](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1814) and Scaling Dataset functionalites [PR1876](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1876) and also studied about CLI and python bindings. Working on those PR taught me some new things about c++, Concepts I really never came across, functuators and specialization.
Both the PR are at verge of completion.

Over the course of this summer I would keep on writing weekly updates, about my project. Till then :).

\note
It isn't about this project, so its totally your wish to go through this.

Also this summer along with acceptance from GSOC, I also got accepted into **`ACM Summer School` on `Geometric Algorithms and their Applications`** at `National Institute of Science Education and Research `, Bhubaneswar organised by ACM. I am very happy to be one among 30 students all over india. The camp is scheduled to be from 3 - 15 june. I am sure, it wouldn't hinder my progress since, I would be working for mlpack during my evenings and nights. Check out the [topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xicja8PtTwHcCuszVSbSE9JDB260tJk1fcie0oxU20A/edit?usp=sharing) , Being fascinated about mathematics, I am sure to learn new things this summer and also who knows, come up with something for mlpack.
