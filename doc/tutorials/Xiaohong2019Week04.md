@section Xiaohong2019Week 4 Proximal Policy Optimization - Week 4


This week, I mainly focus on Proximal Policy Optimization pull request.

* Added `Step` and `Episode` function in PPO algorithm.
* Added initial test case for the PPO algorithm.
* Opened a PR for the the pendulum environment.
* Added action prediction in the PPO algorithm.

I choose the continuous task, pendulum, to test the PPO algorithm, it seems
that some code in the original code base did not support the continuous task.
Next week, I will change that one.

Thanks for reading :).
