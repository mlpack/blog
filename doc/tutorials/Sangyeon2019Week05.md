@section Sangyeon2019WeekFive Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models - Week 5

This week, I implemented QGMM in Python.
<br>
* QuantumGaussianDistribution
* QuantumGMM
* QuantumEMFit

However, I've stucked with the initialization of the parameters to train and through the conversation with the mentor, the equations that originally proposed in the paper are needed to be checked. So, next week, we'll check the equations by implementing QGMM using the optimizer in tensorflow.

Thanks for reading :)
