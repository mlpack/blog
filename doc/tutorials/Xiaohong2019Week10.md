@section Xiaohong2019WeekTen Proximal Policy Optimization - Week 10


This week, I rewrite the normal distribution by my own, so I can predict 
the normal distribution's parameter mean and variance to construct distribution. 
Then the agent can sample action by using the distribution. After carefully read 
the diagonal Gaussian distribution may can have the same functionality, maybe I can 
change to use this. 

This week, I was stuck in how to backward gradient through the network. With 
the help of members in mlpack community, I have a more clear mind on that now. 
Maybe next week I can solve this problem.  

Thanks for reading :).
