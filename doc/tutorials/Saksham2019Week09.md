@section Saksham2019Week9 Implementing Improved Training Techniques for GANs - Week 9

This blog post has been long due. I am sorry for the delay. Actually I just moved back to India and there has been a load of work since college has started. I have tried to keep up with the coding. Currently I am working on Conditional GAN and resolving issues with other PRs. I believe that the work for the my regularizers is for now complete and it is ready to be merged.
For Conditional GAN I think I might need to implement a visitor that can call the `Concat()` function for the `Concatenate<>` layer. Once that is done I think that the implementation would be ready to go and I will add a test for the same.
