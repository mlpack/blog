@section Sangyeon2019CBP Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models - Community Bonding Period

In this summer, I will research and develop 'Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models(QGMM)' with my mentor Sumedh Ghaisas.
The Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models is a extension of Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM). To be more specific, the wave function in quantum physics is applied to QGMM for more precise estimations.

\note You can refer to the original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09199.pdf

During the Community Bonding Period, there were some discussions with the mentor to double-check the objective of this research is and how the research is carried out. First of all, I will check the 3D probability space to visualize and check the interference phenomena of QGMM using matplotlib in Python. From the research, I think the features of QGMM can be figured out by comparing the classical GMM.

Thanks for reading :)
