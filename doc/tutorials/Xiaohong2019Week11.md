This week, I finally completed the backward process of the network. The problem 
is a little bit of challenge for me in the beginning. The key to solving this 
problem is that we need to have a clear understanding of how to network graph 
build so that we can backward the error through the graph. If I come across 
the same problem with more complicated graph, I think I can solve it on my own.
I am here to thank @zoq that give me much help in practice.

Thanks for reading :).
