@section Jeffin2019Week04-06 String Processing Utilities - Week 08 - 09

The Post would contain updates from Week 08 and 09, So let's start.

The previous week was interesting, Thanks to Mikhail, he did a benchmark on my [PR1814](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1814#issuecomment-515183624) and found out some interesting results. He will make apt changes and merge the PR. 

For the string Cleaning PR, I made some changes such as the use of Log:: Fatal instead of throw and other some minor changes. Coming week I have to benchmark some function similar to what Mikhail did, I am trying to get used to google benchmark, and also learning how to use it. Also after the PR1814 is merged I will try to complete other encodings soon.

Also, happy I passed the second evaluation :). Maybe I am not on track but hopping to up the anty in last phase.

Thank you :)
